# Cryptography

This directory contains articles related to cryptography. Cryptography is the study of ciphers and other methods of securing information and communications. Cryptography is intensely focused on mathematics and algorithms and is fundamental to all secure communications today.

As a sidenote, there is some debate over whether or not steganography is considered a form of cryptography. If you are looking for steganography-related content, you can find it under [forensics](../forensics/).
