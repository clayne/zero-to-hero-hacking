# Zero to Hero Hacking

This repository is a comprehensive guide to computer hacking featuring CTF writeups as well as general information and tutorials for common tools, techniques, protocols, and the like. This repository is maintained by Shawn Duong and is a "live" repository, meaning that it will be continually updated. If an article is out of date then please submit an issue and it will be resolved.

## Overview

This repository is split into a couple of different directories:

## Prerequisites

In order to dive into computer hacking, it is recommended that you are already well acquainted with at least one programming language! For many, Python is the obvious choice as it allows for rapid scripting and exploit development. Once you know one programming language, it becomes much easier to learn others.

**Critical languages:**
- C/C++ for lower-level programming.
- Python for higher-level programming.

**Other recommended languages:**
- Bash for shell scripting.
- Intel x86 Assembly for reverse engineering.

## Starting Point

For beginners, it is recommended that you start at the [basics](./basics/) and then read up on some CTF [writeups](./writeups/).

As a beginner, it's very easy to get intimidated! Remember that many of us in the field were in your shoes at one point, and we all know what it's like to be a beginner. Trust in yourself, keep learning, and never stop learning. More than anything else, "hacking" is a mindset that embraces a journey of never-ending learning and critical thinking.
