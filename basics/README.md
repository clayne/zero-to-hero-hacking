# Basics

If you don't know the first thing about hacking, then you're in the right place. Here, we will answer some fundamental questions about hacking and get you oriented before you embark on more in-depth topics.

## Legality

Contrary to popular belief, **hacking is not inherently illegal.** The term used to describe illegal cyberactivity is *cybercrime*, not *hacking.* These two are not necessarily synonymous. In the United States, the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act) is the primary legislation on **computer hacking.** You may want to check with your local legislation. This is not legal advice.

## Hacking

Wikipedia defines a "hacker" as "a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means." It is most associated with computer security, although it is not exclusive to. It is the utilization of both technical skill and creativity to think outside the box and accomplish otherwise impossible ends.

Some examples of computer hacking may include:
- A hacker can bypass password protection and access an account without needing the password.
- A hacker can use an input field such as a search bar on a website to leak all data, including user accounts and passwords.
- A hacker can break into wireless networks or force devices to automatically connect to malicious wireless networks.
- A hacker can sniff and inspect unencrypted wireless data being transmitted by a device to discover sensitive data.
- A hacker can perform byte transplants on files to repair and recover data.
- A hacker can analyze hidden or invisible disk sectors to recover evidence of cybercrime for use in proceedings.

There are multiple specialities within computer hacking. These may include:
- Web application security
- Network security
- Digital forensics
- Reverse engineering
- Binary exploitation
- Intelligence
- Cryptography

## Hacker Culture

The field today is comprehensive, vast, and more active than ever. There are hundreds of conventions and meet-ups every single year and thousands of events. Perhaps none are more universally recognized than **capture the flag** (CTF) competitions in which hackers set up challenges for other hackers to solve using creative problem-solving techniques.

## Next Steps

This repository features a wide variety of resources to learn from and is continually being added to every single week. Consider going back to the overview and picking something you might be interested in. For beginners, you may want to have a look at the CTF writeups in the [writeups](../writeups/) directory. This can expose you to some of the challenges and methodologies that hackers employ.
